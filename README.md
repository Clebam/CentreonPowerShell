# Description

CentreonPowerShell module is designed to wrap the centreon Command Line API (CLAPI) into PowerShell Syntax.

The general idea is to benefit from PowerShell's strength and ease of use, and also to help people that know better Microsoft's scripting than Bash, Python or Perl.

The recent release of PowerShell Core 6.0 on Linux systems allows to use PowerShell now, and even though it still lacks some features, it gets the job done.

# Work In Progress - Translating
__Suspended for now : Centreon is upgrading clapi and I wait to see how it impacts the project__
See the project : [Project](https://github.com/Clebam/CentreonPowerShell/projects/1)

See the current milestone : [MileStones](https://github.com/Clebam/CentreonPowerShell/milestone/1)

# To do

- Translate the command from CLAPI into PowerShell functions
- Stengthen pipelining design
- Create useful function like `Get-CentreonHost -full` that would return all the info linked to the Host
- Review Comment Based Help to make them consistent
- Test, test, test again...
